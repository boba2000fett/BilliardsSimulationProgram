Here is a Billiards C# Simulation Application! This simulation represents a simulation of the game, with there being 2 players. The simulation utilizes random probability to determine whether a player pockets or misses a ball. Give the program a run, and you will see diagnostics from that run of the simulation!

This project was from a class I took during my studies at Davenport University named Introduction to Modeling and Simulation. This course was structured around creating models and simulations that represent real world scenarios. In the class, the program Sigma was often used to create scenarios discussed in class. With Sigma, it is possible to export a simulation as workable C code. For one of my assignments for the class, we had to take this C code generated from the Sigma program and rework it into working C# code. This project is the working result of that project!
